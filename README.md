Didn't irssi-growl let me choose an icon?

Yes, it did and still does, that is if you choose to use growl. But Mountain Lion's Notification Center doesn't let you specify a custom icon for a notification. To quote terminal-notifier's repository:

> The Notification Center always uses the application’s own icon, there’s currently no way to specify a custom icon for a notification. The only way to use this tool with your own icon is to include a build of terminal-notifier with your icon instead.

I will keep track of terminal-notifier's commits and if someone does find a way to specify an icon I will update this script as soon as possible.
